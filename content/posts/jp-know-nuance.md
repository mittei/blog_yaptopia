This post aims to explain nuances of Japanese words that may not be immediately obvious (especially those whose dictionary definitions are too imprecise).

New entries will be added as I find interesting words to compare.

## 手伝う, 助ける, 救う, 救出する / help, rescue

- 手伝う: Used for helping someone with a task by directly getting involved in it, cooperating with the person/people.
Giving advice a few times wouldn't count as 手伝う. The doer has to be animate. One exception is the phase Nも手伝って, where N is an inanimate thing and is one of the reasons/factors that contributes to the result described in the main clause.
    - Good: 晩ごはん作るのを__手伝って__くれない？
    - Unnatural: この教科書は、私の日本語の勉強を大いに__手伝って__くれた。
    - Good: アニメの流行も__手伝って__、日本への観光客は急増している。
- 助ける: In everyday conversation, this is usually used when helping someone out of some undesirable situation they can't resolve themselves. However, the noun form 助け is often used for less "serious" help, sometimes the doer being inanimate.
    - Good: 職場の人間関係で深刻に悩んでいたところを、田中さんが__助けて__くれた
    - Unnatural: 晩ごはん作るのを__助けて__くれない？
    - Good: コミュニケーションのスキルを磨いておくと、様々な場面で__助け__になる。
- 救う: This is also for helping someone out, but more dramatic than 助ける, often out of life-threatening dangers or serious personal problems. It can be physical or emotional.
    - Good: 人生に絶望していたが、田中さんの言葉に__救われた__
- 救出する: Close to "rescue". Similar to 救う, but less dramatic and only physical. The doer has to be animate, usually a professional like a firefighter, soldier, etc. Commonly used in news.
