This post aims to explain nuances of Japanese words that may not be immediately obvious (especially those whose dictionary definitions are too imprecise).

New entries will be added as I come with interesting stuff to write.

## 手伝う, 助ける, 救う, 救出する / help, rescue

- 手伝う: Used for helping someone with a task by directly getting involved in it, cooperating with the person/people.
Giving advice a few times wouldn't count as 手伝う. The doer has to be animate (Exception: Nも手伝って can be used with inanimate objects).
    - Good: 晩ごはん作るのを手伝ってくれない？
    - Unnatural: この教科書は、私の日本語の勉強を大いに手伝ってくれた。
- 助ける: In everyday conversation, this is usually used when helping someone out of some undesirable situation they can't resolve themselves. However, the noun form 助け is often used for less "serious" help, sometimes the doer being inanimate.
    - Good: 職場の人間関係で深刻に悩んでいたところを、田中さんが助けてくれた
    - Unnatural: 晩ごはん作るのを助けてくれない？
    - Good: コミュニケーションのスキルを磨いておくと、様々な場面で助けになる。
- 救う: This is also for helping someone out, but more dramatic than 助ける, often out of life-threatening dangers or serious personal problems. It can be physical or emotional.
    - Good: 人生に絶望していたが、田中さんの言葉に救われた
- 救出する: Close to "rescue". Similar to 救う, but less dramatic and only physical. Usually done by a professional like a firefighter, soldier, etc. The doer has to be animate. Commonly used in news.
