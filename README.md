# Yaptopia Blog

Source code of [Yaptopia](https://mittei.neocities.org/).

It's based on Hugo, a static site generator.

## Workflow

Whenever I push commits to the main branch, GitHub automatically does the following:

1. Builds the website (i.e. generates html/css/js/other assets).
2. Push the files to Neocities.
